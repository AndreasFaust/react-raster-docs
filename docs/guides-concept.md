**Layouting user-interfaces is tough.** Every viewport-size needs its own composition.
**react-raster** provides a simplified, but flexible interface for **CSS Grid Layout**. With **react-raster** defining a grid and placing and stacking boxes is as easy as never before.

---

### 1. Define your Grid and style it in one place

Setup the layout and styling for every `Box` at every breakpoint directly in your **react**-component. No need for switching files or scrolling around. **react-raster** provides a concise API directly via **props**.

---

### 2. Nest components within each other while keeping the original grid

When components are wrapped inside each other, **react-raster** keeps track of your original **Grid-settings**. **react-raster** adds `margin` and `padding` to **Grid Layout**.

---

### 3. Combine react-raster components with other frameworks

**react-raster** is highly composable. You can use it alongside all your favourite tools.
