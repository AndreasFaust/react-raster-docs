Seeing the rise of `Tailwind` and `Chakra JS`, I adapted some new concepts and filled in the missing pieces, to make working with `react-raster` finally truely satisfying.

### Whatâ€™s new:

- Only one component remaining: `Box`
- `API-naming` much closer to regular CSS
- Nearly all `CSS`-properties as `React`-props like in Chakra
- Built in `Intersection Observer` on demand
- Performance optimization
- Does not provide fallback for browsers, that do not support `CSS Grid`, anymore.

### Migration

Migrating is a bit of an effort, because many props changed names.
